# Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale

**Identifier:** ADHD

**Description:**
The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) version 1.1 is a diagnostic tool designed for the assessment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults. Developed in collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO) and researchers at Harvard Medical School, the ASRS v1.1 is grounded in the criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). The tool consists of 18 items that reflect the DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD, divided into two main symptom domains: inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity.

## Questions:

- How often do you make careless mistakes when you have to work on a boring or difficult project?
- How often do you have difficulty keeping your attention when you are doing boring or repetitive work?
- How often do you have difficulty concentrating on what people say to you, even when they are speaking to you directly?

- How often do you find yourself talking too much when you are in social situations?
- When you are in a conversation, how often do you find yourself finishing the sentences of the people you are talking to, before they can finish them themselves?
- How often do you have difficulty waiting your turn in situations when turn taking is required?
- How often do you interrupt others when they are busy?
- How often do you have trouble wrapping up the final details of a project, once the challenging parts have been done?
- How often do you have difficulty getting things in order when you have to do a task that requires organization?
- How often do you have problems remembering appointments or obligations?
- When you have a task that requires a lot of thought, how often do you avoid or delay getting started?
- How often do you fidget or squirm with your hands or feet when you have to sit down for a long time?

## Insight:
Your assessment results indicate a total score of 18 for ADHD, with a breakdown of 6 in Part A and 12 in Part B. This information helps to provide a more tailored analysis and set of recommendations.

### Understanding Your Scores

- **Part A** focuses on core symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity that are critical in ADHD diagnosis. A score of 6 suggests that while there may be some symptoms present, they may be on the milder side or not pervasive across all areas of your life.
- **Part B** assesses the impact of these symptoms on your day-to-day life, including work, relationships, and general functioning. A score of 12 indicates that these symptoms are causing more noticeable challenges or disruptions in your daily activities or quality of life.

### Insights

1. **Symptom Severity**: Your overall score suggests that while you may have some symptoms typical of ADHD, they are affecting your life significantly, especially as reflected in Part B. This could mean that even if your symptoms aren"t severe across the board, they"re impacting key areas of functioning.

2. **ADHD Type**: If most of your symptoms are in Part B and related to impacts rather than core symptoms (Part A), it might indicate that the primary challenge lies in managing the effects of symptoms rather than the intensity of the symptoms themselves.

### Recommendations

1. **Professional Evaluation**: Consider seeking a comprehensive evaluation by a qualified healthcare provider or a psychologist specializing in ADHD. They can provide a more nuanced understanding and confirm if these symptoms align with an ADHD diagnosis.

2. **Self-Management Strategies**: Explore practical strategies to manage symptoms impacting your daily life. This might include:
   - Time management tools like planners or digital apps specifically designed for ADHD.
   - Organizational techniques, such as breaking tasks into smaller steps.
   - Mindfulness or relaxation techniques to help with impulse control and focus.

3. **Support Systems**: Engage with support groups or communities, either in person or online. Sharing experiences and strategies with others facing similar challenges can offer valuable insights and encouragement.

4. **Health and Lifestyle**: Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep can significantly affect ADHD symptoms. Consider integrating these habits into your routine to help manage symptoms.

5. **Education and Advocacy**: Learn as much as you can about ADHD. Understanding the condition empowers you to advocate for yourself in professional, academic, and personal settings.

It"s important to remember that ADHD manifests uniquely in each individual. A professional assessment is crucial both for diagnosis and for tailoring treatment or management strategies to your specific needs.
