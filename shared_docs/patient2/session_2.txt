[00:00:00 - 00:00:15]

CLIENT: Hi, good morning.

THERAPIST: Good morning. How are you doing today?

CLIENT: Better than last week, actually. I managed to sleep for about six hours last night, which is an improvement.

THERAPIST: That's good to hear. What do you think helped with the sleep?

CLIENT: Well, I tried that breathing exercise you suggested, and I also put my blood pressure monitor in the bathroom cabinet instead of keeping it on my nightstand.

THERAPIST: How did it feel to move the monitor away from your bedside?

CLIENT: Anxiety-provoking at first, honestly. But then I realized I was checking it every time I woke up, which was making me more anxious. It was like a vicious cycle.

THERAPIST: That's a really important insight. You recognized a pattern that wasn't serving you well. How has your week been overall?

CLIENT: Mixed. I had two good days where I actually felt motivated to do some cooking, which my husband was thrilled about. But then yesterday I had a really bad day.

THERAPIST: Can you tell me about what made yesterday particularly difficult?

CLIENT: I had my quarterly diabetes appointment, and even though my A1C was actually good, I spent the whole day before the appointment convinced they were going to find something terrible. I barely slept the night before.

THERAPIST: It sounds like anticipating the appointment was really challenging. What was going through your mind?

CLIENT: All the worst-case scenarios. What if my kidney function was declining? What if I needed insulin? What if they found signs of nerve damage? I know it's probably irrational, but I can't stop my brain from going there.

THERAPIST: Those concerns don't sound irrational to me - they're real potential complications that people with diabetes can face. The question is whether the level of worry you're experiencing is helpful or if it's causing you more distress than necessary.

CLIENT: It's definitely causing more distress. After the appointment, when everything was fine, I felt so drained from all that worrying. And then I felt angry at myself for wasting so much energy on anxiety.

THERAPIST: What would you say to a friend who was in your situation - someone who was worried about their health and then felt angry at themselves for worrying?

CLIENT: I'd probably tell them that it's normal to be concerned about their health, especially with a chronic condition. I'd be much kinder to them than I am to myself.

THERAPIST: That's interesting. It sounds like you have compassion available, but you have trouble directing it toward yourself. What do you think makes it harder to be kind to yourself?

CLIENT: I guess I feel like I should be stronger. My mother managed her diabetes for twenty years without all this anxiety. I feel like I'm being weak or dramatic.

THERAPIST: You mentioned last week that your mother had diabetes. How did she handle her diagnosis?

CLIENT: She just took it in stride, followed her diet, took her medication, and didn't seem to worry about it much. But thinking about it now, this was also twenty years ago when there wasn't as much information available online.

THERAPIST: That's a good point. The amount of health information available now can be both helpful and overwhelming. Do you find yourself looking up diabetes-related information online frequently?

CLIENT: Way too much. Sometimes I'll start with one innocent search and end up reading horror stories for hours. My sister told me I should stop, but it's like I can't help myself.

THERAPIST: What drives that need to search for information? What are you hoping to find or understand?

CLIENT: I think I'm trying to feel more in control, like if I know everything that could happen, I can prevent it somehow. But it has the opposite effect - I just feel more scared and out of control.

THERAPIST: That makes a lot of sense. The desire to feel in control when facing uncertainty is very human. Have you noticed any patterns in when you're most likely to start searching online?

CLIENT: Usually when I'm feeling a physical symptom that worries me, or late at night when I can't sleep. Actually, now that I think about it, it's often when I'm already feeling anxious about something else.

THERAPIST: So it sounds like the online searching might be both a symptom of anxiety and something that increases it. What do you think might happen if you tried to limit your health-related internet searches?

CLIENT: Part of me thinks I'd feel less anxious, but another part of me worries that I'd miss something important. What if there's new research or warning signs I should know about?

THERAPIST: Those are valid concerns. What if we worked on finding a middle ground - perhaps designated times for health information that's from reliable sources, rather than late-night internet searches?

CLIENT: That actually sounds reasonable. Maybe I could talk to my doctor about reliable sources and set specific times, like once a week, to check for updates.

THERAPIST: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How do you think your husband would feel about that plan?

CLIENT: He'd probably be relieved. He's been so patient, but I know it's hard for him to watch me spiral into these worry cycles. Last week he found me crying in the kitchen at 2 AM because I'd been reading about diabetic complications.

THERAPIST: It sounds like your health anxiety is affecting not just you, but your relationship as well. Have you and your husband been able to talk about how this is impacting both of you?

CLIENT: A little, but I mostly try to hide how bad the anxiety gets because I don't want him to worry more than he already does. But I think he knows anyway.

THERAPIST: What do you imagine might happen if you were more open with him about your struggles?

CLIENT: I'm afraid he'll get tired of dealing with it, or that he'll start seeing me as fragile and sick instead of as his partner. But maybe that's not fair to him - maybe he wants to help and I'm not letting him.

THERAPIST: As we wrap up today, what feels most important to focus on for the coming week?

CLIENT: I think I want to try that structured approach to health information, and maybe have an honest conversation with my husband about how he's feeling about all this.

THERAPIST: Those both sound like meaningful steps. Remember to be patient with yourself as you try these new approaches. I'll see you next week?

CLIENT: Yes, same time. Thank you.
