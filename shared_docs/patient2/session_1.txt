BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

THERAPIST: Good morning, please have a seat wherever you're comfortable.

CLIENT: Thank you. I'm sorry I'm a few minutes late, I had to check my blood sugar in the car.

THERAPIST: That's perfectly fine. How are you feeling today?

CLIENT: Honestly? Not great. I've been having trouble sleeping again, and when I don't sleep well, everything feels harder.

THERAPIST: I can understand that. Sleep difficulties can really impact how we cope with daily challenges. Can you tell me a bit about what's been keeping you awake?

CLIENT: My mind just won't turn off. I keep thinking about my health, checking my blood pressure monitor multiple times before bed. Last night I was convinced my heart was beating irregularly.

THERAPIST: That sounds really distressing. When you say you're thinking about your health, what specifically goes through your mind?

CLIENT: Well, ever since I was diagnosed with diabetes and high blood pressure, I can't stop worrying about complications. I read online about people who have heart attacks or strokes, and I convince myself that every little symptom means something terrible is happening.

THERAPIST: It sounds like the health concerns are creating a lot of anxiety for you. How has this been affecting other areas of your life?

CLIENT: Everything, really. I've called in sick to work three times this month because I was too exhausted or too worried to function. My family keeps asking if I'm okay, which makes me feel guilty because I know they're worried about me too.

THERAPIST: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden. When you mention feeling guilty about your family worrying, can you tell me more about that?

CLIENT: I just feel like I'm not the person I used to be. Before all this health stuff started, I was the one taking care of everyone else. Now I feel like I'm just this anxious, depressed person who can't even take care of herself properly.

THERAPIST: That's a significant change to adjust to. You mentioned feeling depressed - how long have you been experiencing those feelings?

CLIENT: It's been building up for over a year now, but it really got bad after my diabetes diagnosis. Some days I can barely get out of bed. I used to love gardening and cooking for my family, but now nothing brings me joy.

THERAPIST: Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed can be really difficult. You mentioned that your sister has been helpful - what kind of support does she provide?

CLIENT: She listens when I need to talk, and she doesn't judge me for being anxious about my health. But I feel bad always dumping my problems on her. She has her own life and her own struggles with depression.

THERAPIST: It's understandable that you want to be mindful of not overwhelming your sister. At the same time, it sounds like having someone who understands is valuable to you. Have you been able to find other ways to cope when the anxiety and depression feel overwhelming?

CLIENT: I used to pray and meditate regularly, which really helped me feel centered. But lately, I can't focus long enough to do either. My mind just jumps to all the things that could go wrong with my health.

THERAPIST: It can be frustrating when coping strategies that used to work become difficult to access. Let's talk about what brings you here today. What are you hoping to work on in therapy?

CLIENT: I want to feel like myself again. I want to stop being so consumed by worry about my health that I can't enjoy my life. And I want to sleep through the night without waking up in a panic about my heart rate or blood sugar.

THERAPIST: Those are very understandable goals. It takes courage to reach out for help when you're struggling. What does feeling like yourself again look like to you?

CLIENT: Being able to wake up and look forward to the day instead of dreading it. Being present with my grandchildren instead of being distracted by health worries. Getting back to cooking and gardening - things that used to bring me peace.

THERAPIST: Those sound like meaningful and achievable goals. As we work together, we can explore ways to help you manage the health anxiety while also addressing the depression that's been affecting your daily life. How does that sound to you?

CLIENT: That sounds good. I'm willing to try anything at this point. I just want to feel hopeful again.

THERAPIST: I can hear how much you want things to improve, and that motivation will be an important part of our work together. Before we finish today, is there anything else that feels important for me to know about what you're experiencing?

CLIENT: Just that I know my family loves me and wants to help, but I don't want to be a burden. I want to get better not just for myself, but for them too.

THERAPIST: That shows how much you care about your family. As we work together, we'll also explore how taking care of yourself is actually a way of taking care of them too. I'll see you next week at the same time?

CLIENT: Yes, thank you. I'm hoping this will help.
